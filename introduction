(1) What is cloud computing ?
Ans:- * Cloud computing means storing and accesing data and programs over the 
       internet instead of your computers hard drive.
      * Delivery of different services through the internet.
      * cloud computing is a technology that allows users to access and use computing
        resources (such as servers, storage, databases, networking, software ) over
        the internet, typically through a service provider.

   Disadvantages:- (1) Integration Challenges
                   (2) Management Complexity
                   (3) Data Security Concern

(3) Service Model in cloud ?
Ans:- (1) Infrastructure as a service (laaS):-  
         * Provide virtualized computing resources over the internet.
         * Users have control over the operating system, applications, 
           and some networking components.
         * Examples:- Amazon EC2, Microsoft Azure Virtual Machines.
      (2) Platform as a Service (PaaS):-
         * Users focus on application development without managing the
           underlying infrastrututre.
         * Examples:- Google App Engine, Microsoft Azure App Service.
      (3) Software as a Service (Saas):-
         * Delivers software applications over the internet on a subcription
           basis.
         * Examples:- Google Workspace, Microsoft 365, Salesforce.
            

(4) Architecture of Cloud Computing ?
Ans:- 1. Frontend
      2. Backend
  Frontend:- It contains all the user interfaces and application which are 
             used by the client to access the cloud computing services.
           * Client Infrastructure
  Backend:- It contains resources as well as manages the resources and provides security
             mechanisms.
           * Application
           * Service
           * Runtime
           * Storage
           * Infrastruture
           * Management
           * Security
           
(5) AWS Global Infrastructure Count ?
Ans:- * AWS has a vast global infrastructure with data centers located in various regions 
        around the world. 
      * As of my last knowledge update, AWS operates in 25 geographic regions, including Pune,
        Maharashtra, India. 
      * Each region consists of multiple availability zones, which are separate data centers 
        within that region. 
      * This extensive infrastructure allows AWS to provide reliable and scalable cloud services
        to users worldwide.

(6) Why do we use region ?
Ans:- * We use regions in AWS to ensure high availability, fault tolerance, and low latency for
        our applications and services. 
      * By choosing a specific region, we can deploy our resources closer to our target audience
        or leverage specific regulatory requirements. 
      * It also allows us to replicate data across multiple regions for disaster recovery purposes.
      * Regions in AWS act as separate geographic areas with their own data centers, giving us the 
        flexibility to optimize performance and meet our specific business needs.

(7) What is service and why we use resources ?
ans - 1. * In the context of cloud computing, a service refers to a specific functionality or 
           capability that is provided by a cloud provider, such as AWS. 
         * These services can include computing power, storage, networking, databases, machine 
           learning, and more. 
         * They are designed to be accessible over the internet and can be used to build, deploy, and
           manage applications and infrastructure in the cloud.
       2.* On the other hand, resources in the context of AWS are the individual components or entitie 
           that you create and manage within the AWS environment. 
         *  These resources can include virtual machines (EC2 instances), storage buckets (S3 buckets), 
           databases (RDS instances), and more.
         * Each resource has its own characteristics, configurations, and settings that you can control 
           and manage based on your requirements.
      3. * So, in simple terms, services are the functionalities provided by AWS, while resources are 
           the individual components or entities that you create and manage within those services.
         * It's like using different tools (services) to create and manage various objects (resources) 
           in the AWS cloud.
