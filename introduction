(1) What is cloud computing ?
Ans:- * Cloud computing means storing and accesing data and programs over the 
       internet instead of your computers hard drive.
      * Delivery of different services through the internet.
        

(2) Deployment Model in cloud ?
Ans:- * In cloud computing a deployment module refers to a package or unit of software
       that is deployed and run on  cloud infrastruture .



(3) Service Model in cloud ?
Ans:- * It can include services like storage, computing power, networking,database,
         and more.

(4) Architecture of Cloud Computing ?
Ans:- * The architecture of cloud computing typically involves a combination of   
        different components.
      * At a high level, it includes the following Layer.
      1. * Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS): This layer provides virtualized computing
         resources like virtual machines, storage, and networks.
         * It gives you the flexibility to manage and control the underlying infrastructure. 
      2. * Platform as a Service (PaaS): This layer provides a platform for developing, testing, 
           and deploying applications.
         * It includes tools, frameworks, and runtime environments to simplify the application 
           development process. 
      3. * Software as a Service (SaaS): This layer offers ready-to-use software applications that 
           are accessible over the internet.
         * Examples include email services, customer relationship management (CRM) systems, and 
           collaboration tools. 

(5) AWS Global Infrastructure Count ?
Ans:- * AWS has a vast global infrastructure with data centers located in various regions 
        around the world. 
      * As of my last knowledge update, AWS operates in 25 geographic regions, including Pune,
        Maharashtra, India. 
      * Each region consists of multiple availability zones, which are separate data centers 
        within that region. 
      * This extensive infrastructure allows AWS to provide reliable and scalable cloud services
        to users worldwide.

(6) Why do we use region ?
Ans:- * We use regions in AWS to ensure high availability, fault tolerance, and low latency for
        our applications and services. 
      * By choosing a specific region, we can deploy our resources closer to our target audience
        or leverage specific regulatory requirements. 
      * It also allows us to replicate data across multiple regions for disaster recovery purposes.
      * Regions in AWS act as separate geographic areas with their own data centers, giving us the 
        flexibility to optimize performance and meet our specific business needs.

(7) What is service and why we use resources ?
ans - 1. * In the context of cloud computing, a service refers to a specific functionality or 
           capability that is provided by a cloud provider, such as AWS. 
         * These services can include computing power, storage, networking, databases, machine 
           learning, and more. 
         * They are designed to be accessible over the internet and can be used to build, deploy, and
           manage applications and infrastructure in the cloud.
       2.* On the other hand, resources in the context of AWS are the individual components or entitie 
           that you create and manage within the AWS environment. 
         *  These resources can include virtual machines (EC2 instances), storage buckets (S3 buckets), 
           databases (RDS instances), and more.
         * Each resource has its own characteristics, configurations, and settings that you can control 
           and manage based on your requirements.
      3. * So, in simple terms, services are the functionalities provided by AWS, while resources are 
           the individual components or entities that you create and manage within those services.
         * It's like using different tools (services) to create and manage various objects (resources) 
           in the AWS cloud.
